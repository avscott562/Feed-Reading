Feed Reader testing

By: Alicia Scott


# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Run the application

This project can be accessed at https://github.com/avscott562/Feed-Reading.  Open the 'index.html' file in your browser.  After the page loads, scroll to the bottom to see the Jasmine test results.  Edit the 'feedreader.js' file to correct any errors.



## Dependencies

This project/program is dependent upon Jasmine [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for its testing.
